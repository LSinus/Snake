# Snake
Snake Game in C++ with SFML

The game is a simple reproduction of the classic Snake, the main goal of the player is to eat apples in order to let snake grow, the wall and snake's body are the enemies, you always need to avoid to get in touch with them!!

At first there's only one Apple but later as the velocity increases two more apples will spawn randomly around the map!

# Installation
To play the game you only need to download the repository, open the folder and double-click Snake.exe
you can play either with W-A-S-D or with arrow-keys.

I hope you enjoy the game!!!
